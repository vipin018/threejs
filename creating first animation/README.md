# Three.js Basics

## Why Do We Use Three.js?

Three.js is a JavaScript library that simplifies the process of creating 3D graphics on the web. 

- **Features:** It provides a wide range of tools and features for creating and rendering 3D scenes, including geometry, materials, lighting, and cameras.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Developers can create interactive 3D content that runs in a web browser without the need for plugins or additional software.
- **Built on WebGL:** Three.js is built on top of WebGL, a low-level API for rendering 3D graphics in the browser, and provides a higher-level abstraction that makes it easier to work with 3D graphics.
- **Applications:** Commonly used for creating games, visualizations, simulations, and other interactive 3D applications on the web.

## How to Create a Basic 3D Animation Using Three.js

To create a basic 3D animation using Three.js, follow these steps:

1. **Set up a scene:** Create a new scene to hold all objects.
2. **Create a camera:** Define a camera to view the scene.
3. **Create a renderer:** Initialize a WebGL renderer to display the scene.
4. **Create objects:** Define geometries and materials to create 3D objects.
5. **Add objects to the scene:** Combine geometries and materials to create meshes and add them to the scene.
6. **Define animation:** Create an animation loop that updates the objects' properties and renders the scene.
7. **Start the animation:** Call the animation loop function to begin the animation.
